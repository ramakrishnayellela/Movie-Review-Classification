# Movie-Review-Classification

Movie Review Classification using RNN
This project implements a machine learning model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model is trained on sentiment analysis datasets and deployed via a Streamlit web application for easy accessibility.

# Key Features:
Sentiment Analysis: Predicts whether a movie review expresses positive or negative sentiment.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Utilizes RNN architecture for sequence modeling and text processing.
Preprocessed Dataset: Implements data preprocessing techniques like tokenization, padding, and word embeddings.
Streamlit Deployment: Offers a user-friendly web interface for inputting and analyzing reviews in real time.

# Tools & Technologies:
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the RNN model.
Python Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and more for data preprocessing and visualization.
Streamlit: For deploying the web application.
IMDB Dataset: Used for training and evaluating the model.

# How It Works:
Input a Review: Users can input their own movie review through the web app.
Text Preprocessing: The app preprocesses the input review, including tokenization and padding.
Prediction: The trained RNN model predicts whether the review is positive or negative.
Output: The app displays the sentiment result (e.g., Positive or Negative) with confidence scores.
